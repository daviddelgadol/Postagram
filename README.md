# Postagram

Postagram is an Instagram clone using a custom Parse backend server and database made possible by https://www.back4app.com/. The app allows a user to sign up, log in, post photos, view a global photos feed, and add comments. Upon users sign up, the database stores their login information, pictures and captions posted, as well as all the comments received in their posts. 

This app does not use any API, as this project was for me to learn how to integrate a custom database designed for web and mobile applications.
